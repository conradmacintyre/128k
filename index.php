				<p>Hi, my name is Conrad. I make things. Sometimes they're good.</p>

				<h2 class="about-me_title">About Me</h2>
				<p>As I attempt to write up an "about me" that is even remotely usful or interesting, I find myself struggling. Is this a personal site? An online resume? Man, who knows. Hopefully by the time you're done reading this, you'll have a better idea about who I am.</p>
				<p>I have political opinions. I don't feel compelled to share them publically.</p> 
				<p>I love my family. All my choices are filtered through the lens of what I feel is best for my children. They are easily the greatest thing I have ever helped to create. But let's by honest; my wife did all the hard parts.</p>
				<p>I like TV more than movies. But I am a sucker for franchises and LOVE reboots. I adored Rocky 6, am looking forward to Bill & Ted 3 more than is reasonable, and would go opening night to see Gramlins 3.</p>
				<p>Best dramatic show of the 60s is The Fugitive, 70s is The Rockford Files, 80s is MacGyver (maybe Quantum Leap), 90s is Law & Order (maybe X-Files), 00s is 24 (maybe LOST). Has there been a good show this decade?</p>
				<p>I used to be a pastor, now I'm a web developer, perhaps in the future I'll be something different again. My vocation doesn't define who I am. It's just something I do. And, honestly, my work falls well below being a dad and teaching my sons how to be good men in terms of definition and fulfillment.</p>
				<p>If you want to reach out or do something together, I'm always excited to work on something great. <a href="#contact-me">Let's do it!</a></p>

							<h3>Buck 'N' Pat Bingo</h3>
							<img src="images/bingo.jpg" alt="">
							<p>If you watch the Blue Jays much, you'll quickly hear some of the broadcaster's favourite phrases. This is an attempt to make those common sayings a little more fun. So tune into the Jays and <a href="#">play along</a>!</p>

							<h3>Blackjack</h3>
							<img src="images/blackjack.jpg" alt="">
							<p>This was a student project I built as an assignment while I was at BCIT. It stands as my favourite thing I built while I was there. I still play it on a regular basis. Wanna <a href="#">play a hand</a>?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="project-specifics">
							<h3>Brand Wars (Pre-Alpha)</h3>
							<img src="images/brand-wars.jpg" alt="">
							<p>When WWE Smackdown! vs RAW 2006 was released the "GM Mode" blew my mind. It was like franchise, but for pro-wrestling. Ever since it was removed in 2009, I stopped buying WWE games annually, and typically pick up used copies every couple years. I want to build my own version. That's what this work-in-progress is. Want to play a rough pre-alpha build of the booking/match engine? <a href="#">Give 'er a go</a>!</p>
						</div>
						<div class="project-specifics">
							<h3>Family Feud (Beta)</h3>
							<img src="images/family-feud.jpg" alt="">
							<p>As a youth pastor I needed to make some games that could be played by a fairly large group in a fairly small space. Game shows seemed like a great option. So I threw this together. Currently they have no documentation, but I'll work on that. In the meantime, feel free to <a href="#">poke around</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="about-me_title">Thoughts on Design</h2>
			<p>As I began in hobbyist web development (circa 1999), I regarded design and appearance as synonyms. Design was, to my mind, making something "look cool". Turns out "looking cool" is both extremely subjective and inadequate as a definition of design. While appearance is obviously not without its merit, it is but one facet of design.</p>
			<p>It took years before this idea rooted itself in my mind. Some time in 2006 I had my first experience with an Apple product â€” the iPod. It was my girlfriend's and it was, much to my surprise as a then Mac-hater, awesome. And as I thought about why it was so awesome I realized that it was the union of the user interface and the user experience. The marriage of form and function.</p>
			<p>It was the design. As Steve Jobs once said:</p>
			<blockquote>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
			I believe this philosophy should permeate every aspect of what we do. Especially as a web designer.</blockquote>
			<p>I always want to do something great. Something of value. Something that I'm proud to put my name on. 
			Let's do that together.</p>
