				<h2 class="about-me_title">Design philosophy</h2>
				<img src="_images/ipod-mini.jpg" alt="" class="float:left">
				<p>As I began in hobbyist web development (circa 1999), I regarded design and appearance as synonyms. Design was, to my mind, making something "look cool". Turns out "looking cool" is both extremely subjective and inadequate as a definition of design. While appearance is obviously not without its merit, it is but one facet of design.</p>
				<p>It took years before this idea rooted itself in my mind. Some time in 2006 I had my first experience with an Apple product — the iPod. It was my girlfriend's and it was, much to my surprise as a then Mac-hater, awesome. And as I thought about why it was so awesome I realized that it was the union of the user interface and the user experience. The marriage of form and function.</p>
				<p>It was the design. As Steve Jobs once said:</p>
				<blockquote>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</blockquote>
				<p>I believe this philosophy should permeate every aspect of what we do. Especially as a web designer.</p>
				<p>I always want to do something great. Something of value. Something that I'm proud to put my name on. 
				<a href="#contact-me">Let's do that together</a>.</p>

						<p>As I attempt to write up an "about me" that is even remotely usfeul or interesting, I find myself struggling. I mean, this is clearly an online résumé or portfolio, so I should probably keep it professional, but at the end of the day, I want you to get a sense of who I am. Hopefully by the time you're done reading this, that will have been achieved.</p>
						<p>I enjoy debate, which is probably why I poke fun at <a class="popup-link" data-content="calvin-meme">Calvinists</a> so often.</p>
						<div id="calvin-meme" class="popup-content">
							<img src="_images/calvin-meme.jpg" alt="">
						</div>
						<p>I love my family. All my choices are filtered through the lens of what I feel is best for my children. They are easily the greatest thing I have ever helped to create. But let's by honest; my wife did all the hard parts.</p>
						<p>I like TV more than movies. But I am a sucker for franchises and love reboots that come in the form of sequels. I adored Rocky 6, am looking forward to Bill & Ted 3 more than is reasonable, and would go opening night to see Gremlins 3.</p>
						<p>Best dramatic show of the 60s is The Fugitive, 70s is The Rockford Files, 80s is MacGyver (maybe Quantum Leap), 90s is Law & Order (maybe X-Files), 00s is 24 (maybe LOST). Has there been a good show this decade?</p>
						<p>I used to be a pastor, now I'm a web developer, perhaps in the future I'll be something different again. My vocation doesn't define who I am. It's just something I do. And, honestly, my work falls well below being a dad and teaching my sons how to be good men in terms of definition and fulfillment.</p>
						<p>If you want to reach out or do something together, I'm always excited to work on something great.</p>

					<p class="description">When WWE Smackdown! vs RAW 2006 was released the "GM Mode" blew my mind. It was like franchise, but for pro-wrestling. Ever since it was removed in 2009, I have longed for its retun. I want to build my own version. That's what this work-in-progress is. Want to play a rough pre-alpha build of the match engine?</p>
