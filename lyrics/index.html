		<h1>10,000 Reasons</h1>
		<h3>Verse 1:</h3>
		<p>
		The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning<br>
		It's time to sing Your song again<br>
		Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me<br>
		Let me be singing when the evening comes<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Chorus:</h3>
		<p>
		Bless the Lord oh my soul<br>
		oh my soul<br>
		Worship His holy name<br>
		Sing like never before<br>
		Oh my soul<br>
		I'll worship Your holy name<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Verse 2:</h3>
		<p>
		You're rich in love and You're slow to anger<br>
		Your name is great and Your heart is kind<br>
		For all Your goodness I will keep on singing<br>
		10,000 Reasons for my heart to find<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Verse 3:</h3>
		<p>
		And on that day when my strength is failing<br>
		The end draws near and my time has come<br>
		Still my soul will sing Your praise unending<br>
		10,000 Years and then forever more<br>
		</p>

		<h1>Before The Throne</h1>
		<h3>Verse 1:</h3>
		<p>
		Before the throne of God above<br>
		I have a strong, a perfect plea<br>
		A great high Priest whose Name is Love<br>
		Who ever lives and pleads for me<br>
		My name is graven on His hands<br>
		My name is written on His heart<br>
		I know that while in heaven He stands<br>
		No tongue can bid me thence depart<br>
		No tongue can bid me thence depart<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Verse 2:</h3>
		<p>
		When Satan tempts me to despair<br>
		And tells me of the guilt within<br>
		Upward I look and see Him there<br>
		Who made an end to all my sin<br>
		Because the sinless Savior died<br>
		My sinful soul is counted free<br>
		For God the just is satisfied<br>
		To look on Him and pardon me<br>
		To look on Him and pardon me<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Verse 3:</h3>
		<p>
		Behold Him there the risen Lamb<br>
		My perfect spotless righteousness<br>
		The great unchangeable I am<br>
		The King of glory and of grace<br>
		One with Himself I cannot die<br>
		My soul is purchased by His blood<br>
		My life is hid with Christ on high<br>
		With Christ my Savior and my God!<br>
		With Christ my Savior and my God!<br>
		</p>

		<h1>He Reigns</h1>
		<h3>Verse 1:</h3>
		<p>
		It's the song of the redeemed<br>
		Rising from the African plain<br>
		It's the song of the forgiven<br>
		Drowning out the Amazon rain<br>
		<br>
		The song of Asian believers<br>
		Filled with God's holy fire<br>
		It's every tribe, every tongue, every nation<br>
		A love song born of a grateful choir<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Chorus:</h3>
		<p>
		Glory, glory, hallelujah<br>
		He reigns, He reigns<br>
		Glory, glory, hallelujah<br>
		He reigns, He reigns<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Verse 2:</h3>
		<p>
		Let it rise about the four winds<br>
		Caught up in the heavenly sound<br>
		Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals<br>
		To the faithful gathered underground<br>
		<br>
		Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation<br>
		Some were meant to persist<br>
		Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples<br>
		None rings truer than this<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Bridge:</h3>
		<p>
		And all the powers of darkness<br>
		Tremble at what they've just heard<br>
		Ã¢??Cause all the powers of darkness<br>
		Can't drown out a single word<br>
		</p>

		<h1>O Praise The Name (Anastasis)</h1>

			My Savior on that cursed tree<br>

			The entrance sealed by heavy stone<br>
			Messiah still and all alone<br>

		<p>
			He shall return in robes of white<br>
			The blazing Son shall pierce the night<br>
			And I will rise among the saints<br>
			My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face<br>
